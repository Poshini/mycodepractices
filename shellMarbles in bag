– Marbles in the Bag.

There are 2 teams. Each team requires S1 and S2 number of marbles respectively to play the game. There are 4 colours of marbles Black, White, Green and Yellow. Each marble is numbered.

Given 2 prime numbers X and Y as input, all the marbles whose number is

Divisible by X is White

Divisible by Y is Black

Divisible by X*Y is Green

And the rest are Yellow.

Team1 can only have Black and Yellow marbles

Team2 can only have White and Yellow marbles.

Given S1, S2, X and Y, find the minimum number of marbles required in the bag for both the teams to be able to play the game.

– Distinct Flowers

From a list of N number of flowers, the girl selects first K flowers.  Among these K flowers, indicate how many selected are distinct considering that each type of flower is numbered and same type of flower is given the same number.

Very easy, but yeah.



print('enter the list of flowers array number in a single line seperateed by spaces.')
myl=list(map(int,input().split()))
k=int(input('enter k : '))
myset=set(myl[:k])
print(len(myset))
